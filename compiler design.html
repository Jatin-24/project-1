        <h1>Compiler Design</h1>
        <br>

        <p>A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language without changing the meaning of
            the program. It is also expected that a compiler should make the target code efficient and optimized in
            terms of time and space.</p>

        <p>Compiler design principles provide an in-depth view of translation and optimization process. Compiler design
            covers basic translation mechanism and error detection & recovery. It includes lexical, syntax, and semantic
            analysis as front end, and code generation and optimization as back-end.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Why to Learn Compiler design?</h4>
        <p>Computers are a balanced mix of software and hardware. Hardware is just a piece of mechanical device and its
            functions are being controlled by a compatible software. Hardware understands instructions in the form of
            electronic charge, which is the counterpart of binary language in software programming. Binary language has
            only two alphabets, 0 and 1. To instruct, the hardware codes must be written in binary format, which is
            simply a series of 1s and 0s. It would be a difficult and cumbersome task for computer programmers to write
            such codes, which is why we have compilers to write such codes.</p>
